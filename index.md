# William Mead

I am a PhD student within the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne.

My research interests are in integrable probability. I am interested in the stochastic dualities and universal current distributions of integrable models, particularly of higher-rank models and models on the half-line.

I'm very casually working on a multi-species ASEP simulation tool in python. If this would be helpful for you then feel free to [contact me](mailto:wmead@student.unimelb.edu.au) and I can share it.
