# William Mead

I am a Hausdorff postdoc at the Institute for Applied Mathematics at the Unversity of Bonn. I am in the [Interacting Random Systems Group](https://wt.iam.uni-bonn.de/people/interacting-random-systems) lead by Patrik Ferrari.

Prior to this, I submitted my PhD thesis at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne where I was supervised by Jan de Gier and Michael Wheeler.

My research interests are in integrable probability, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and solvable lattice models.


My CV is available here.

I'm very casually working on a multi-species ASEP simulation tool in python. If this would be helpful for you then feel free to [contact me](mailto:wmead@uni-bonn.de) and I can share it.
